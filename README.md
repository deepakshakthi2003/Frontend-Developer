## Project Overview

The Netflix Clone Project is an attempt to recreate the look and feel of Netflix's streaming service. It features user authentication, a home page with featured content, a search functionality, and a detailed view for individual movies and TV shows. This project aims to demonstrate skills in frontend and backend development, including working with APIs, responsive design, and user interface design.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, log in, and manage user accounts.
- **Home Page:** Displays featured movies and TV shows with interactive carousels.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for content by title, genre, or keywords.
- **Content Details:** View detailed information about movies and TV shows, including trailers and ratings.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Watchlist:** Users can add content to their watchlist for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Redux (for state management)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - Axios (for HTTP requests)
  - React Router (for navigation)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for database)
  - JWT (for authentication)

- **APIs:**
  - [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) (for movie and TV show data)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Netflix Clone Project, follow these steps to set up the development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn (for package management)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-clone.git
   cd netflix-clone
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   In the `frontend` directory, create a `.env` file and add the TMDb API key:

   ```
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   ```

5. **Start the Development Servers:**

   - For the backend:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```

   - For the frontend:

     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm start
     ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (backend).

## Usage

- **Register or Log In:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
- **Browse Content:** Explore featured content on the home page.
- **Search:** Use the search bar to find movies or TV shows.
- **View Details:** Click on a title to see detailed information and trailers.
- **Manage Watchlist:** Add or remove items from your watchlist for quick access.
